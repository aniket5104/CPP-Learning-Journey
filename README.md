# 🚀 C++ Learning Journey

Welcome to my C++ learning repository!  
This repo is a personal space where I practice, organize, and build a solid foundation in C++ as I move forward in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and competitive programming.

🌱 **Currently Learning:** Basics to Intermediate C++  
🎯 **Goal:** Master the core concepts of C++ required for DSA and problem-solving

## 📂 Repository Structure

- 📁 **Arrays**  
  Basics of arrays, operations, and problems involving static data structures.

- 📁 **Conditional Statements**  
  `if`, `else`, `switch` cases used to control the program flow.

- 📁 **Functions**  
  Writing reusable code using user-defined and built-in functions.  
  *(Note: Folder name has a typo. Should be "Functions")*

- 📁 **Loops**  
  Covers all loop types – `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.

- 📁 **Practice**  
  Random practice problems from each concept.

- 📄 **first_code.cpp**  
  My first "Hello World!" style program in C++.

- 📄 **input_output.cpp**  
  Understanding basic input/output syntax using `cin`, `cout`.

## 🔥 What's Next?

As I continue learning, I will be adding topics like:

- Pointers (only as required for DSA)
- Recursion
- Strings
- Vectors & STL
- Object-Oriented Programming (optional)

## 🧠 Why This Repo?

- Helps me track my coding progress.
- Aims to serve as a quick revision resource for myself.
- Might help beginners who want to follow a clean structure in their C++ journey.

## 📌 Note

This repository is still under development and will be regularly updated as I progress through each topic.
